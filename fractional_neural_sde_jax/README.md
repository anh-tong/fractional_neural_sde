## Fractional Neural SDE in JAX

Note that the JAX version is developed after our NeurIPS submission. Please refer to PyTorch version for our reported results.

The code is using [diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) and [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) ecosystem.
The architecture U-Net in JAX version is different from that of PyTorch version in which attention layers are included.
